Flexbox and The Better Butter Battle

The CSS portion of class has, so far, been my favorite. I’m a designer, so thinking visually is something that comes naturally to me. Whereas usually I go straight from a sketch to the most appropriate Adobe program, knowing how to manipulate the design with CSS allowed me to go straight from my sketch into Atom to begin coding.

After discussing global design (designing for mobile first and adding the adjusted CSS for larger browser window sizes in afterwards) with Sam Kapila, The Iron Yard’s resident CSS expert, I decided to test my new skills and come up with a project on my own.

Inspired by one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books, _The Better Butter Battle_, I came up with a site that demonstrates when the media query shifts by changing the image shown on the page.

In _The Better Butter Battle_ there are two types of people. Yooks, who wear blue and eat their bread butter side up, and Zooks, who wear orange and eat their bread butter side down. I created two boxes, one for each type and used Adobe Illustrator to create six different graphics.

In mobile view, two butter knives with a smear of butter are displayed, one facing up and one down. The second size reveals two butter dishes, one right side up and the other upside down, and when you get to the largest media query, two pieces of bread are displayed; one with butter on the top and the other dripping butter from the bottom.

This project was a lot of fun to work on, and I hope that it can serve as a visual aid to help anyone new to CSS understand media queries.
